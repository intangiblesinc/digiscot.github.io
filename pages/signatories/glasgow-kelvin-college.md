Glasgow Kelvin College signed the Digital Participation Charter because we recognise that that without both access to and support for digital technologies and social media, people are excluded from information and informed choices, support networks, employment opportunities, learning opportunities, and so much of life in general.  Further, we see digital inclusion as an essential requirement for the realisation of the life-wide learning aspirations of the Statement of Ambition for Adult Learning in Scotland.

The College plays an active role in Glasgow City Council's Digital Glasgow Programme (http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/11205), particularly in relation to the Citizens' Participation workstream lead by the Wheatley Group (http://www.wheatley-group.com/).  
We also provide the technical, information services and training infrastructure which undepins the John Wheatley Learning Network (approximately 30 learning centres hosted by more than 20 partners). In addition to the informal inclusion support offered by learning centre hosts, the College provides certificated flexible learning IT programmes in the learning centres which form the learning network (http://www.northeastglasgow.co.uk/learning/JohnWheatleyLearningNetwork.html).

We are also currently supporting, in partnership with College Development Network (http://www.collegedevelopmentnetwork.ac.uk/news-community-learning/), YouthLink Scotland (http://www.youthlinkscotland.org/) and Learning Link Scotland (http://www.learninglinkscotland.org.uk/) the development of a training resource to support the adoption of and adherence to the Digitally Agile National Principles - a national framework of guiding principles for the use of digital technology and social media in community learning and developmnent (http://www.digitallyagilecld.org/).
